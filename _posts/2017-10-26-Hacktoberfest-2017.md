title: Hacktoberfest 2017
---

This year, for my first time, I decided to participate to [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/),
a month-long celebration of open source software organised by DigitalOcean and Github.

Only one rule: Do 4 Pull Requests with `#hacktoberfest` label to win a T-Shirt.

> 4 Pull Requests in one month ? **EASY !** 

> ...

> **IT WAS NOT !** (more on that in my next post...)

4 Pull Requests in order to win a T-shirt is nice, but tag some of my issues in my projects with #hacktoberfest and receive Pull Requests from other is even better !

I received [3 Pull Requests for the same issue in just one day](https://github.com/Octopussy-Project/Octopussy/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+label%3Ahacktoberfest) !

Next year, I would be more prepared and would tag more issues !
